> Spec: SQLite Database Schema Implementation
> Created: 2025-07-27
> GitHub Issue: #7
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Design and implement a comprehensive SQLite database schema for SPY-FLY to persist trading history, daily sentiment scores, and system configuration settings.

## User Stories

### Trade History Tracking

As an active trader, I want to automatically record all my SPY 0-DTE trades, so that I can track performance over time and analyze my trading patterns.

The system should capture every trade recommendation, whether executed or skipped, along with entry/exit prices, P/L results, and the sentiment scores that drove the decision. This creates a complete audit trail for strategy analysis.

### Performance Analytics

As a systematic trader, I want to view historical performance metrics and equity curves, so that I can evaluate the effectiveness of my trading strategy.

The database should support queries for win rate, average P/L, Sharpe ratio, and other key metrics. Users can filter by date ranges, market conditions, or sentiment thresholds to identify optimal trading parameters.

### Configuration Management

As a SPY-FLY user, I want to customize risk parameters and alert settings, so that the system adapts to my personal trading style and account size.

Settings like buying power limits, risk percentages, and notification preferences should persist between sessions and be easily adjustable through the UI.

## Spec Scope

1. **Trade Records Table** - Store complete trade lifecycle from recommendation to closure
2. **Daily Sentiment Scores** - Archive sentiment calculations with full component breakdowns
3. **Configuration Settings** - User preferences and system parameters with version tracking
4. **Performance Metrics View** - Aggregated statistics for dashboard display
5. **Database Initialization** - Automatic schema creation and migration support

## Out of Scope

- Multi-user support or authentication
- Real-time replication or backup strategies
- Complex reporting or data warehouse features
- Integration with external databases

## Expected Deliverable

1. SQLite database with proper schema, indexes, and constraints
2. All database operations accessible through SQLAlchemy ORM with type safety
3. Alembic migrations configured for future schema evolution
