# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Polygon.io API Integration for SPY Market Data
> Created: 2025-07-27
> GitHub Issue: #5
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive Polygon.io API integration to fetch SPY stock quotes, option chains, and historical data for the automated sentiment analysis and spread selection functionality. This integration serves as the foundational data pipeline for the entire SPY-FLY trading automation system.

## User Stories

### Real-Time Market Data Access

As a systematic trader, I want to access live SPY quotes and option chains automatically, so that my trading decisions are based on current market conditions without manual data entry.

The system should authenticate with Polygon.io, fetch current SPY stock price every 15 seconds during market hours, retrieve complete option chains for 0-DTE expiration, and handle API rate limits gracefully. When market data is unavailable, the system should cache the last known values and alert the user to potential stale data.

### Historical Data for Technical Analysis

As a trader developing systematic strategies, I want access to historical SPY price data, so that I can calculate technical indicators and validate my sentiment scoring algorithm.

The system should retrieve 30 days of historical daily and intraday SPY prices, calculate moving averages and volatility metrics, and store this data locally to minimize API calls. The historical data feeds into the sentiment calculation engine for technical indicator scoring.

### Robust Error Handling

As a user relying on automated trading signals, I want the system to handle API failures gracefully, so that temporary network issues don't disrupt my trading workflow.

When Polygon.io is unavailable, the system should fall back to cached data, retry requests with exponential backoff, log all API errors for debugging, and continue operating with degraded functionality rather than crashing.

## Spec Scope

1. **Polygon.io Authentication** - Secure API key management with environment variable configuration
2. **SPY Stock Quote Fetching** - Real-time price, bid/ask, volume retrieval with WebSocket connection
3. **Option Chain Retrieval** - Complete 0-DTE option contracts with strike prices, premiums, and Greeks
4. **Historical Data Pipeline** - 30-day lookback for daily/intraday prices with local caching
5. **Rate Limiting Implementation** - Respect free tier limits (5 requests/minute) with intelligent queuing
6. **Error Handling Framework** - Comprehensive exception handling with graceful degradation
7. **Data Caching Layer** - SQLite-based cache to minimize API calls and improve performance
8. **API Response Validation** - Pydantic models to ensure data integrity and type safety

## Out of Scope

- Real-time streaming WebSocket connections (Phase 3 feature)
- Multiple symbol support beyond SPY
- Advanced option Greeks calculations (handled by separate module)
- Broker integration or order placement functionality
- Paid Polygon.io tier features (focus on free tier limitations)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Authenticated API Connection** - Successfully authenticate and maintain connection to Polygon.io with proper error handling
2. **Live SPY Data Retrieval** - Fetch current SPY stock price, bid/ask spread, and trading volume on demand
3. **Complete Option Chain Access** - Retrieve all available 0-DTE SPY option contracts with pricing and basic metrics
4. **Historical Data Storage** - Download and cache 30 days of SPY price history in local SQLite database
5. **Rate Limit Compliance** - Implement request queuing that never exceeds free tier API limits
6. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests covering all API endpoints, error conditions, and caching behavior
