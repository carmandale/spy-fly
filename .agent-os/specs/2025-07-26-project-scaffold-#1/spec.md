# Spec Requirements Document

> Status: Planning

## Overview

Set up the foundational project structure for SPY-FLY with FastAPI backend, React/TypeScript frontend, and Docker containerization. This establishes the development environment and basic architecture for all subsequent features.

## User Stories

### Developer Setup Story

As a developer, I want to clone the repository and have the entire application running locally with a single command, so that I can start contributing immediately without complex setup procedures.

The workflow should be:
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add API keys
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Access the app at http://localhost:3000 with API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs

### Basic Integration Story

As a developer, I want to see a working connection between frontend and backend, so that I can verify the full stack is properly configured.

When I load the frontend, it should fetch a health check from the backend API and display the connection status, proving that CORS, routing, and the development proxy are correctly configured.

## Spec Scope

1. **Backend Structure** - FastAPI application with modular organization, environment configuration, and API documentation
2. **Frontend Structure** - React with TypeScript, Vite build system, and Tailwind CSS v4 setup
3. **Docker Configuration** - Multi-stage Dockerfiles and docker-compose for local development
4. **Development Tools** - Hot reloading, linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks
5. **Basic Integration** - Health check endpoint and frontend API client demonstrating connectivity

## Out of Scope

- Authentication and user management
- Database migrations (just basic SQLite connection)
- Production deployment configuration
- CI/CD pipelines
- Actual trading logic or UI components

## Expected Deliverable

1. Running `docker-compose up` starts both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000) with hot reloading
2. Frontend displays "API Status: Connected" after successfully calling backend health endpoint
3. FastAPI automatic documentation accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs
