> Spec: Trade Execution Checklist with Copy-to-Clipboard
> Created: 2025-07-29
> GitHub Issue: #20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a trade execution checklist that generates formatted order tickets from spread recommendations and provides copy-to-clipboard functionality for quick broker entry. This feature bridges the gap between algorithmic recommendations and manual trade execution, enabling users to act quickly on time-sensitive 0-DTE spreads while maintaining proper trade validation and formatting.

## User Stories

### Systematic Trader Order Execution

As a systematic trader, I want to copy properly formatted order details directly to my clipboard so that I can quickly paste them into my broker platform without manual calculations or formatting errors.

**Workflow**: After reviewing morning recommendations, trader clicks "Copy Order" button, switches to broker platform, and pastes complete order details including strikes, quantities, order type, and risk parameters. This eliminates manual transcription errors and reduces execution time from 2-3 minutes to 30 seconds.

### Learning Trader Execution Guidance

As a learning trader, I want a clear checklist of execution steps with validation so that I understand the proper sequence for entering bull-call-spread orders and don't miss critical details.

**Workflow**: System presents step-by-step checklist including market conditions check, position size verification, order details review, and execution confirmation. Each step includes educational context about why it matters for successful trade execution.

### Trade Validation and Risk Check

As any trader, I want the system to validate my intended trade against risk parameters before generating order details so that I never accidentally exceed position sizing rules or enter invalid spread combinations.

**Workflow**: Before generating clipboard content, system verifies trade meets 5% buying power limit, confirms 1:1 risk/reward ratio, validates spread components are properly structured, and checks market hours/liquidity conditions.

## Spec Scope

1. **Order Ticket Generation** - Format spread recommendations into broker-ready order tickets with all required fields
2. **Copy-to-Clipboard Functionality** - Browser-based clipboard API integration with fallback text selection
3. **Trade Execution Checklist** - Step-by-step workflow UI guiding users through proper execution sequence
4. **Order Validation Service** - Backend validation of spread parameters against risk rules before ticket generation
5. **Multiple Broker Format Support** - Generate order tickets in formats compatible with common brokers (Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE)

## Out of Scope

- Actual broker API integration or automated order placement
- Real-time order status tracking from broker systems
- Advanced order types beyond basic limit orders for spreads
- Portfolio-level position management across multiple trades
- Integration with paper trading simulators

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Copy-to-Clipboard** - Users can copy formatted order details and paste them directly into broker platforms
2. **Complete Execution Workflow** - Step-by-step UI guides users from recommendation review to order placement
3. **Order Validation Feedback** - System prevents invalid trades and provides clear error messages when trades violate risk parameters
