# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-trade-execution-checklist-#20/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-29
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Order Formatting Service
- Create `/api/execution/format-order` endpoint that accepts spread recommendation ID and broker format preference
- Generate structured order tickets with all required fields: symbol, strikes, quantities, order type, time in force
- Implement validation layer that verifies spread meets risk parameters before generating ticket
- Support multiple broker formats with template-based rendering system
- Return formatted text optimized for clipboard operations

### Frontend Copy-to-Clipboard Integration
- Implement modern Clipboard API with fallback to legacy document.execCommand for older browsers
- Create reusable `CopyButton` component with visual feedback (success/error states)
- Handle clipboard permissions and provide user guidance when permission denied
- Implement automatic text selection as fallback when clipboard API unavailable
- Add toast notifications for copy success/failure with clear messaging

### Trade Execution Workflow UI
- Design step-by-step wizard interface guiding users through execution process
- Implement progress indicator showing current step in execution workflow
- Create validation feedback system with real-time error checking
- Add confirmation dialogs for critical steps (position size, risk parameters)
- Integrate with existing recommendation display components

### Order Validation System
- Implement comprehensive validation for spread components (strikes, expiration, quantity)
- Verify position sizing against 5% buying power limit using existing position calculator
- Validate risk/reward ratio meets minimum 1:1 requirement
- Check market hours and trading halts before allowing order generation
- Provide detailed error messages with specific remediation steps

### Integration Points
- Connect with existing `/api/recommendations/spreads` endpoint for recommendation data
- Integrate with position sizing calculator from Phase 2 implementation
- Use existing market data service for real-time pricing validation
- Leverage current database models for trade logging and audit trail

## Approach Options

**Option A: Single-Page Modal Workflow**
- Pros: Quick access, minimal navigation, integrates with existing dashboard
- Cons: Limited space for detailed information, may feel cramped on mobile

**Option B: Dedicated Execution Page** (Selected)
- Pros: More space for comprehensive checklist, better mobile experience, clearer workflow
- Cons: Requires navigation, slightly more complex routing

**Option C: Sidebar Panel Workflow**
- Pros: Side-by-side view with recommendations, no page navigation
- Cons: Screen real estate constraints, complex responsive design

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best user experience for a critical trading workflow. The dedicated page allows for comprehensive validation, clear step-by-step guidance, and better mobile responsiveness. Since trade execution is a deliberate, high-stakes action, the slight navigation overhead is acceptable for the improved clarity and safety features.

## External Dependencies

**No new external dependencies required** - All functionality can be implemented using existing stack:
- **Clipboard API**: Built into modern browsers, no library needed
- **Form Validation**: Existing React Hook Form setup
- **UI Components**: Existing shadcn/ui components (Dialog, Button, Progress, Alert)
- **State Management**: Existing Zustand store
- **API Integration**: Existing TanStack Query setup
