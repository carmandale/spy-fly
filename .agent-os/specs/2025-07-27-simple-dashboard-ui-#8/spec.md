# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Simple Dashboard UI Implementation
> Created: 2025-07-27
> GitHub Issue: #8
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a clean, single-page dashboard that displays live SPY market data and sentiment analysis results, completing Phase 1 of the SPY-FLY product roadmap.

## User Stories

### Real-Time Market Monitoring

As an active SPY trader, I want to see current market data and sentiment analysis at a glance, so that I can quickly assess whether conditions are favorable for trading.

The dashboard should display the current SPY price with clear change indicators, the overall sentiment score with a visual representation, and the trading decision (PROCEED or SKIP) in an unmistakable format. All data should update automatically without requiring manual refresh.

### Sentiment Component Visibility

As a systematic trader, I want to understand what factors are driving the sentiment score, so that I can develop intuition about market conditions.

Each sentiment component (VIX, Futures, RSI, MA50, Bollinger, News) should be displayed with its individual score and status. Color coding and labels should make it immediately clear which components are bullish, neutral, or bearish.

### Mobile Trading Access

As a trader on the go, I want to check market conditions from my phone, so that I don't miss trading opportunities when away from my desk.

The dashboard must be fully responsive, providing the same critical information on mobile devices with appropriate touch-friendly sizing and layout adjustments.

## Spec Scope
