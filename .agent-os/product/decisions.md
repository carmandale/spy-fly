## 2025-07-26: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

SPY-FLY will be a web-based automation tool specifically designed for SPY 0-DTE bull-call-spread trading strategies. The product focuses on educational and simulation purposes, automating the morning sentiment analysis, spread selection, and position monitoring workflow without actual broker integration. Key features include automated sentiment scoring, algorithmic spread selection, real-time P/L tracking, and comprehensive performance reporting.

### Context

The SPY 0-DTE options market has grown significantly, with many traders developing systematic approaches to these short-duration trades. However, the manual process of analyzing market conditions, calculating spreads, and tracking performance is time-consuming and prone to emotional bias. This tool addresses these pain points by automating the mechanical aspects while keeping the trader in control of execution decisions.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Full Broker Integration**
   - Pros: Complete automation, no manual order entry
   - Cons: Regulatory complexity, security risks, higher development cost

2. **Cloud-Based SaaS**
   - Pros: No installation, accessible anywhere, recurring revenue
   - Cons: Data privacy concerns, ongoing hosting costs, latency issues

3. **Desktop Application**
   - Pros: Better performance, native OS integration
   - Cons: Platform-specific development, distribution complexity

### Rationale

The web-based, self-hosted approach balances ease of development with user control. By focusing on educational/simulation use, we avoid regulatory complications while still providing value. The specific focus on SPY 0-DTE bull-call-spreads allows for deep optimization of the workflow rather than mediocre support for many strategies.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster time to market with focused feature set
- Complete user control over data and deployment
- Lower barrier to entry for users (just a web browser needed)
- Clear educational positioning avoids regulatory issues

**Negative:**
- Manual order entry still required
- Self-hosting may intimidate non-technical users
- Limited to single strategy initially

## 2025-07-26: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use FastAPI (Python) for backend with React/TypeScript frontend, SQLite for data storage, and Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui for styling. Deploy initially to local Mac development environment with Docker containerization for future portability.

### Context

The technology choices need to balance rapid development, maintainability, and alignment with modern web development practices. The PRD specified some technologies, but we needed to finalize specific versions and complementary tools.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Django + Traditional Templates**
   - Pros: Batteries included, simpler deployment
   - Cons: Less suitable for real-time WebSocket features, older patterns

2. **Next.js Full-Stack**
   - Pros: Single language (TypeScript), integrated deployment
   - Cons: Less suitable for Python-based financial calculations

3. **PostgreSQL from Start**
   - Pros: Production-ready, better concurrency
   - Cons: Overhead for single-user application, complex setup

### Rationale

FastAPI provides excellent performance with automatic API documentation and native WebSocket support crucial for real-time P/L updates. React with TypeScript ensures type-safe frontend development. SQLite is perfect for the data volume (250 trades/year) while SQLAlchemy provides an upgrade path. Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui enables rapid UI development with professional results.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Modern, well-documented technology stack
- Fast development with type safety throughout
- Easy local development with minimal setup
- Clear upgrade path for all components

**Negative:**
- Two languages to maintain (Python/TypeScript)
- Requires Node.js and Python environments
- More complex than single-language solution

## 2025-07-26: Risk Management Approach

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Risk Management

### Decision

Implement hard-coded risk limits of 5% maximum buying power per trade and require minimum 1:1 risk/reward ratio for all spread recommendations. Include automated stop-loss alerts at -20% of maximum risk but keep execution manual.

### Context

Risk management is crucial for any trading system. While the tool is educational, establishing good risk practices is essential for user learning and preventing catastrophic losses if users follow recommendations with real money.

### Rationale

Fixed percentage risk (5%) is a widely accepted practice that prevents position sizing errors. The 1:1 risk/reward minimum ensures trades have positive expected value. Automated alerts with manual execution maintains trader control while providing timely notifications.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enforces disciplined risk management
- Prevents catastrophic losses from position sizing errors
- Educational value in demonstrating proper risk practices

**Negative:**
- Less flexibility for experienced traders
- May filter out some profitable opportunities
- Requires users to act on alerts manually
